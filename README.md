# VBScript Function Unexpected Return Value

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in a VBScript function. When the input value (x) is less than or equal to 10, the function is expected to return x + 1. However, it returns unexpected values.  This example highlights a common issue in VBScript related to implicit variable assignments and function return values.
